Hello world! Welcome to SocketSnake!

In this repository, you will find two versions/adaptations of the classic snake arcade game:
1) NonOnline Snake - this is a project I developed independently using PyCharm. It is essentially the same as the original snake, but it has a few major twists. It is multiplayer, meaning you can have multiple snakes play in the same game. If one snake hits another snake, it is eliminated. The goal is to be the last snake standing.
2) Networked Snake - This is the relatively the same as "NonOnlineSnake". There is only one major difference - the snakes are controlled by different machines/clients using the server and client python files.

How to run the games:
1) NonOnlineSnake: If you would like to run this version, clone the project onto your local computer, and run "main.py". It's really that easy!
2) NetworkedSnake: Clone the project onto your computer, run main.py on the computer you would like to host the game on. Run client.py on the computers of the people that would like to play. **IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WINDOWS** - If you have a windows machine, simply download the appropriate .exe file found in the "ExecutableFiles_Windows" folder. Then run the .exe

All of this project was developed independently by me (Benjamin Hatch). Enjoy!

**If you do not have windows, you might need to install Python 3 and/or Pygame**
